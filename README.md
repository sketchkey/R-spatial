# R-spatial
Code for working with different types of spatial data in R

### Script overview
- [gwfr_example_kdes.R](gfwr_example_kdes.R) - making kernel density maps from fishing vessel data
- highres_maps.R - making ultra-high resolution maps of custom areas from openstreetmap data
- terra_rasterizing - turning point/line spatial data into rasters with terra

### Cool data sources (future viz ideas)
- [Central park squirrels](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Squirrel-Census-Fur-Color-Map/fak5-wcft)
- [Antarctic iceberg tracks](https://github.com/chrieke/iceberg-locations-data)
