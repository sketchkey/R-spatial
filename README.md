# R-spatial
This repo contains code for working with a bunch of different types of spatial data in R

### Script overview
- [gwfr_example_kdes.R](gfwr_example_kdes.R) - making kernel density maps from fishing vessel data
- [highres_maps.R](highres_maps.R) - making ultra-high resolution maps of custom areas from openstreetmap data
- [terra_rasterizing.R](terra_rasterizing.R) - turning point/line spatial data into rasters with terra
- [kde_overlaps.R](kde_overlaps.R) - calculating the proportion of spatial overlap between two KDE's
- [inset_globe.R](inset_globe.R) - making maps with a shaded globe map inset

### Cool data sources (note to self of future viz ideas)
- [Central park squirrels](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Squirrel-Census-Fur-Color-Map/fak5-wcft)
- [Antarctic iceberg tracks](https://github.com/chrieke/iceberg-locations-data)
